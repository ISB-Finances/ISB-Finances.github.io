I am also interested in finance and investing and realised that due to the vast amount of info there is its difficult to know where to begin so this could be a starting point for a students interested in finance as well.I was a complete beginner learning how to code an actual project for the first time. I learned the basics from how to pull and push code from github, how to plan, organise and execute an idea with a team remotely and how to make a basic react.js app and the basics of javascript, html and css as well. I worked on the dropdown navigation bar as well as the about us section',
